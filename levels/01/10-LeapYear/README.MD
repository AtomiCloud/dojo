# Leap Year

For each year from 1900 to 2100, print "Leap" if it is a leap year, else print the year

A Leap Year is a year that is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

## Expected

```
1900 => 1900
1901 => 1901
1902 => 1902
1903 => 1903
1904 => Leap
1905 => 1905
1906 => 1906
1907 => 1907
1908 => Leap
1909 => 1909

1997 => 1997
1998 => 1998
1999 => 1999
2000 => Leap
2001 => 2001
2002 => 2002

2096 => Leap
2097 => 2097
