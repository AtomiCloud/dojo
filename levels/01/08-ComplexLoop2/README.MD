From 30 to 77,
- if the nubmer ends with 9, print the number itself
- else
    - print the square of the number
    - then, if the number is even, print the cube of the number too
    - then, the number ends with 7, print the number minus 2, then multiply by 3 too
    - then, if the number is divisible by 7, print the negative of the number
